These scripts are used to extract Arabeyes' technical dictionary in various formats. As
far as I can tell, the dependencies are XML::Simple and Locale::PO (on debian
libxml-simple-perl and liblocale-po-perl) for the perl scripts, XeLaTeX with the etoolbox
package (on debian, texlive-xetex and texlive-latex-extra) and dictfmt.

The main script is buildtechdict, it calls the other scripts to generate all the files.
By default it stores its working files in ~/techdict and copies the results to
~/public_html/techdict, but these can be changed.

Some (most) of these scripts were written by Djihed Afifi <djihed@gmail.com>.
